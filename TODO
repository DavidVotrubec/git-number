- Make git-list works in a different directory than where git-number was run.
- Handle status for modified files in submodule. For example for this status line:

	#3      modified:   script/guider-js (modified content, untracked content)

  Wrong:

	$ git list 3
	"script/guider-js (modified content, untracked content)"

  Correct:

	$ git list 3
	script/guider-js
